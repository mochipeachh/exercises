    <h1>A bit about me</h1>
    <section>
        <p>I'm not sure how to go about showing you who I am in a string of words, but I will try!
            I'm 26, and I have completely forgotten any semblance of who I am as a person now that I have to write this.
            Truthfully,
            I think I'm the kind of person who likes to hear about other people rather than talk about myself, learning
            new things
            and looking into the lives of others always feels so intimate and profound. As you can probably tell by now,
            I like to
            romanticize things. I just think, why not look for extra beauty in all the corners of the world, I don't
            think anything
            that makes life a little bit brighter could ever be a bad thing.
            I believe that each person's life is defined by a collection of their favourite things, times, places and
            people. Here
            are some of mine.</p>
